## **Harvey & Co - A fictional but fun website developed to highlight the talents of Harvey and his hairy crew, and my burgeoning talents as a Full Stack Developer. It was written with Python, using the Flask framework and was deployed to Heroku.I hope you enjoy looking at as much as I have enjoyed creating it.**
